# Cryptopals
My solves of cryptopals.com crypto challenges

Everything is written in horrible CTFish Python so it's pretty horrible to look at. Also disclaimer: DO NOT EVER USE ANY OF CODE FROM THIS REPOSITORY IN REAL CRYPTO. 
In scripts where I implement some crypto there are intentionally implemented  vulnerabilities. 
Also my honest advice - do not roll your own crypto in any case.
