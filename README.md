# Cryptopals
My solves of cryptopals.com crypto challenges

Everything is written in horrible CTFish Python so it's pretty awful to look at. Also disclaimer: DO NOT EVER USE ANY OF CODE FROM THIS REPOSITORY IN REAL CRYPTO. 
There are intentionally implemented vulnerabilities in scripts where I implement some crypto 
Also my honest advice - do not roll your own crypto in any case.
